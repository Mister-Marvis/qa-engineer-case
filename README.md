# MR MARVIS QA Engineer Assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) todo app.

## Assignment

1. Implement [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
2. Create at least 2 unit tests.
3. Implement [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
4. Create at least 2 E2E tests.
5. Create `qa.md` that contains at least 3 potential suggestions to improve _quality_.
   - Code quality or any other suggestions to reduce potential bugs and increase confidence in releases.

## Deliverable

- Use TypeScript.
- Ensure it's easy for your colleagues to run the tests.
- A ZIP file with the source code. Send it over per email. Please do _not_ put the results on GitHub, BitBucket, etc.

## Notes

- We'd rather have you state you don't know something than to deliver messy code or badly implemented features.
- Simple is better. Do not over-engineer.
- Quality `>` quantity.
- Be pragmatic, not dogmatic.
- If you don't enjoy doing it, you're doing it wrong :)
- If you have questions, please ask.

## Getting started

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
# then open localhost:3000
```
